# react-employee-directory

## Description

https://rafaelrosas19.github.io/react-employee-directory/

The purpose of this application is to allow a manager or employee the ability to view an employee directory so they can quickly access a colleague's contact information without having to scroll through a series of many pages.

## Installation

To use this repository you will need Node and React.

## Usage

To use the application simply type the name of the employee that you are looking for into the search box. If there are no employees in the directory with that name then you will see "Please try another user." However, if you find an employee that you are looking for then you will see their phone number and email. 

## Things I learned

Making this application was very rewarding for me because I got to practice using APIs and Material UI. Initially, when I first started the program I felt overwhelmed by the idea of pulling so much data and having to sort it. However, the more I practiced and the more I became familiar with data objects and the spread operator then it became something I could understand. I also was able to practice more with React props, state and hooks. Overall, building this application was a great experience for me.
